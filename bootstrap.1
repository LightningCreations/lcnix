.SH NAME
lcnix-bootstrap \- Bootstraping Script for lcnix
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bootstrap.sh
[\fI\,OPTIONS\/\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Bootstraps lcnix into \fI\,/mnt/lfs\/\fP or a specified sysroot
This program is path sensitive. The script must exist from the root of the lcnix source directory. It may be ran from any directory
.SH OPTIONS
.HP
\fB\-\-sysroot=\fR<path>: Installs to <path> instead of \fI\,/mnt/lfs\/\fP. Directory must be writable by the effective user id
.HP
\fB\-\-toolchain=\fR<toolchain>: Builds using <toolchain> instead of the default builtin lccc. Acceptable values are lccc and llvm
.HP
\fB\-\-stage=\fR<stage>: Builds <stage> and all preceeding stages, where stage is between 0 and 2. Defaults to 2
.HP
\fB\-\-start\-from=\fR<stage>: Starts builds from <stage>, instead of stage 0. Accepts the same values as stage.
.HP
\fB\-\-build\-stage=\fR<stage>: Same as \fB\-\-stage=\fR<stage> \fB\-\-start\-from=\fR<stage> (that is, builds <stage>, and only <stage>)
.HP
\fB\-\-enable\-external\-toolchain\fR[=\fI\,opt\/\fR]: Configures whether to use an external toolchain build. Acceptable values are yes, auto, and no. Defaults to auto
.HP
\fB\-\-disable\-external\-toolchain\fR: Same as \fB\-\-enable\-external\-toolchain\fR=\fI\,no\/\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-with\-parallel\-jobs=\fR<jobs|auto>: Builds each stage using the specified number of jobs, or 2*core count if auto is specified. Defaults to auto
.HP
\fB\-\-without\-parallel\-jobs\fR: Forces each stage to be built in serial. Same as \fB\-\-with\-parallel\-jobs\fR=\fI\,1\/\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-enable\-kernel=\fR<kernel>: Builds the specified kernel, instead of the lcnix kernel. Acceptable values are lcnix and linux.
.HP
\fB\-\-disable\-kernel\fR: Do not build any kernel during stage2. Appropriate kernel headers MUST be on a standard search path before building either stage 1 or stage 2
.HP
\fB\-\-with\-kernel\-config=\fR<file>: Builds the kernel against the specified config file. Only meaningful when using \fB\-\-enable\-kernel\fR=\fI\,linux\/\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-enable\-verbose\fR[=\fI\,opt\/\fR]: Prints verbose information about the operation. If opt is omitted, defaults to yes. Acceptable values are yes and no
.HP
\fB\-\-disable\-verbose\fR: Disables verbose information. Same as \fB\-\-enable\-verbose\fR=\fI\,no\/\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-help\fR: Prints this message and exits
.HP
\fB\-\-version\fR: Prints version information and exits
